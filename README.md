# Fall of Artica

> In his 1979 book, "What is Universal Pragmatics?", Jürgen Habermas posits that human rivalry, disputes, and tactical maneuvers are essentially failed efforts to reach mutual understanding, hindered by misunderstandings about intentions or states of affairs.

"Fall of Artica (FoA)" is an open-source game that unfolds within a post-apocalyptic, dystopian world that plunges players into a science fiction narrative with the unresolved societal issues of our times. By leveraging the concept of "Fictional Distance"[1] and employing a participatory action learning framework[2], FoA invites players into a pluralistic exploration of complex modern dilemmas such as freedom and safety, the present and the future, as well as value and utility. This game fosters critical thinking and offers an immersive yet safe space for individuals to engage with and deeply reflect upon societal conflicts. 

Story Fragments and Items
The latest version of the stories is available on GitHub. Bo Tang authored every word based on our previous concepts. A minor update is planned for September, but the main conflicts among regions will remain unchanged (see attached files).

These stories are designed for a gaming experience, which differs from traditional novel reading. We employ a “fragmented storytelling” approach, where students will receive only small fragments of the story. To piece together the complete narrative, interaction among students is essential. Since no single student will have all the information, you don’t need to understand everything immediately. The goal is to grasp the overall “flavor” of the story.

Note: Both “story fragments” and “items” contain crucial information for completing the game. It’s recommended to start with one location, reading both the “story fragments” and “items” sections. A good starting point is Mirror City (https://github.com/FoA-game/MirrorCity?tab=readme-ov-file) , which is particularly relevant to visual art. From this link, you can also access other regions. Once you finish the Mirror City story, the next recommended region to explore is Fortress, as it pairs well with Mirror City. However, the choice is entirely up to you—these are just suggestions.

Epistemic Index for Regional Relations
The attached visual diagram titled "Fall of Artica: Epistemic Index for Regional Relations" illustrates the core thematic conflicts within the story. Each region embodies different conceptual dichotomies:

Utility vs. Value
Freedom vs. Security
Future vs. Present
These opposing themes drive the narrative and define the relationships between regions. For example, Mirror City represents the conflict between Value and Utility, while Fortress represents Utility and its opposition to Value, which is why they are suggested as paired regions to explore.

As you navigate through the story fragments, keep these conflicts in mind, as they will help you understand the underlying tensions and motivations of the characters and regions. This diagram serves as a guide to contextualize your reading experience and enhance your understanding of the overarching narrative structure.
